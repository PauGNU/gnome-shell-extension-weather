2012-10-12: Forked the project from:

	https://github.com/simon04/gnome-shell-extension-weather

   to

	https://github.com/canek-pelaez/gnome-shell-extension-weather

   Also, ported the code so it works in GNOME Shell 3.6, fixed some
   issues, improved the build system, and added support for
   preferences using the gnome-shell-extension-prefs tool.
